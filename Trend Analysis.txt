1. Even though Males make up 84% of the playerbase, Females spend, on average, 10% more than their male counterparts 
and other genders spending the most.
   Avg Total Purchase by Gender (per person)
   Female     Male       Other / Non-Disclosed
   $4.47      $4.07      $4.56
 
2. While most of the playerbase is between the ages of 20 and 24. There are more players 25+ than there are less than 20. However,
even though older players are more likely to have jobs and earn more income, there is little to no difference in the Avg Total Purchases 
of those under 25 and those 25 and over. Meaning, each age spends relatively equally. 


3. The most profitable Item is also the most popular item, Final Critic. Purchased 13x for an average price of $4.61. Even though it is
not the highest average item price, it's popularity helped it become the most profitable. Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm
is also the 2nd most popular and as a result 2nd most profitable.
